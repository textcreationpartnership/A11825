            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>But farre greater miſerie did our forefathers endure in pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, when many honeſt and wel-affected hearts were forced to bee kept &amp; preſſed downe vnder the Popes tyrannie, and to behold (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their wils) ſhamefull and horrible idolatrie. But yet God did after ſeuen hundred yeeres

               </p>
               <p>It is true, that Ieruſalem is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten grieuouſly afflicted, and as it were euen rent aſunder, either by the aſſaults and inrodes of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſouldiers, or by the death of high and chiefe Gouernours, who were the Churches Patrons, and nureing fathers and mothers, as this Jeruſalem of our Palatinate hath ſufficiently felt about three

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17555:14"/>and where the ſame is preached, there he powreth out the ſupling and healing oyle of grace into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie repentant ſinners heart, and bindeth vp all their wounds, that is, he taketh away all the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and trouble of conſcience, which ariſeth out of the ſence and feeling of Gods wrath againſt ſin, and feare of euerlaſting damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And here I know, that many men eſteeme not ſo highly of this benefit, and I meane them, who vnderſtand not what ſinne is, what Gods wrath is againſt ſinne, and what euerlaſting damnation is.

               <p>We muſt needs wonder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17555:17"/>the cloudes; and we muſt needs wonder co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the rain: but yet we muſt needs much more admire and wonder, that God createth ſuch things, not, that he boaſteth of his omnipotencie, but of his goodneſſe therein, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo euidently appeareth in the very preſeruation of bruit beaſts. For why doth the Lord couer the heauens with cloudes? That he may prepare raine for the earth. Wherefore doth hee prepare raie ffor the earth? That graſſe may grow vpon the mountaines. Wherefore doth hee let graſſe grow? That beaſts may haue their foode, and the yong rauens that call vpon him.</p>
               <p>So then we heare it well, that God careth alſo for the bruite beaſts, as likewiſe for the yong ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, which call vpon him; that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17555:18"/>is, they which crie for hunger, and muſt needs periſh, if God did not nouriſh them. The heathen Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> taught, that God onely cared for the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creatures, and regarded not the meaner.</p>
               <p>But Gods word teacheth, that God alſo preſerueth the young ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens when they call vppon him, and ſoe maketh no difference in his care for this or that beaſt; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in like manner concerning man, <hi>He is no accepter of perſons: but in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery nation,</hi>

               <p>And it is not hard or heauie vnto God the Lord, to nouriſh, preſerue, and ſupport both man, and beaſt. For,<note place="margin">verſe 15.</note> 
                  <hi>He only ſendeth forth his commandements vppon earth:</hi> that is, he only comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, <hi>and his word runneth very ſwiftly,</hi> that is, and it is done.

               <p>Now that which Gods people
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17555:19"/>did here praiſe aforetime, that are we worthily bound to extoll and praiſe at this day.

Therefore the Prophet reioyceth and triumpheth withall, for this benefit, that God offereth vnto the Iewiſh people, his euerlaſting grace and mercy in the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: and for that the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was at that time altogether ſhut vp within the cabinet of the Land of <hi>Iudah,</hi> hee proceedeth herehence with admiration, and ſaith; <hi>Hee hath not dealt ſo with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery nation, neither letteth them know his iudgements.

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:17555:29"/>The <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Bauaria,</hi> were once a kingdome, yet ſubiect (as other States) vnto alteration and change.<note place="margin">Chron Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian. lib. 4.

In the lower the Prince hath 26. walled Townes, beſides an infinite number of good and faire Villages, 22. houſes; and the land is very fruitfull of wine, corne, and other comfortable fruites for mans vſe, hauing the Rheine &amp; Neckar running throgh it. The vpper Countrey hath not ſo many walled townes and princely houſes, but thoſe that are, be generally fairer then in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, eſpecially <hi>Amberg</hi> and <hi>New-market.</hi>

            <p>For her Highneſſe receauing: After that ſhe had paſſed the low Countries, the Dukedomes of <hi>Gulick, Cleue,</hi> and <hi>Mont,</hi> the <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes of Collen,</hi> and <hi>Trier,</hi> with a part of the <hi>Landgraue</hi> of <hi>Heſſens</hi>
